# Learnings Directory

This directory tracks what works and what doesn't for your guidelines.

## Purpose

Guidelines represent current best practices. This directory captures **evolution**:
- Experiments and outcomes
- Patterns that worked or failed
- Why guidelines changed over time

## Structure

Create files for different topics:
- `git-workflow.md` - Git practice learnings
- `testing.md` - Testing approach learnings
- `general.md` - General observations

## Important

**These files are NOT included in builds.** They have zero context weight and are purely for:
1. Tracking how understanding evolves
2. Providing context when updating guidelines
3. Documenting experiments

## When to Update

Add entries when:
- ✅ You try a pattern and it works/fails
- ✅ You make an adjustment to guidelines
- ✅ You discover something surprising
- ✅ You complete an experiment

## Format

Use date-stamped entries:

```markdown
**2025-01-15: Discovered X pattern works well**
- Context: Working on feature Y
- Outcome: Reduced bugs by Z
- Adjustment: Updated common/testing.md to recommend X
```
